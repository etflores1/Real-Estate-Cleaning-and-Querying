## Project Description
The US real estate market has been undergoing great changes in the recent years. Using **SQL**, I will manage a local database containing [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset) from Kaggle which contains over 900,000 with information like price, acre lots, house size, and location about various listings on the market. In addition with this, I will provide a **Tableau** dashboard that will convey my analytical findings.
